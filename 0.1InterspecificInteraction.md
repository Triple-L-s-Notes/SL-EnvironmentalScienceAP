# #0.1 Interactions between the different species - Interspecific Interactions

The notes were taken from Khan Academy's (AP Environmental Science) video.

### Some Basic concepts

-    community: population sharing habitat. It consists of biotic factors (living things).
-    competition: populations compete for resources (i.e. shelter, sunlight, water).

Then we introduce a notation organism\\organism:

The more of one, there will be a more negative effect on another, e.g. sheep eats grass (herbivory), and wolf eats deer. Then we have predation\herbivory from the relationship, which is +\\-. 

>    More grass $\rightarrow$ predators benefit +
>
>    More predators $\rightarrow$ grass decreases -

-    predation: one population likes to eat another.
-    symbiosis: (not only) organisms benefit each other, (but) hurt each other, ∨ one benefits one does not.
     1.    parasitism (similar to predation): good for parasite, bad for host (here we can introduce +\\-).
     2.    mutualism: benefit both organisms (+\\+), e.g. clownfish\\shelter (which is sea anemone).
     3.    commensalism: one may benefit or hurt another but the other one does not care (+\\?). It can convert to parasitism (+\\-) ∨ mutualism (+\\+) at any time as we go deeper in research, e.g. bacteria\\skin. It could be both parasitism or mutualism depending on types of bacteria.
